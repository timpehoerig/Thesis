## Overview

### Abstract

Typesystems are an essential and powerfull part of every modern programming language.
But to be forced to explicitly write down every typesignature can be annyoing or
finding the most general types even can be difficult.
By making the type system able to infer types by itself those problems become obsolete.
This in a global typeinference algorithm for Featherweight Generic Java.
