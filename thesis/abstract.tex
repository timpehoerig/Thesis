Typesystems are an essential and powerfull part of every modern programming language.
But to be forced to explicitly write down every typesignature can be annyoing or
finding the most general types even can be difficult.
By making the type system able to infer types by itself those problems become obsolete.
This is a global typeinference algorithm for Featherweight Generic Java a minimal core calculus for Java (Featherweight Java) extended with Gemerics.
This implements a typeinference algorithm defined in the paper "Global Type Inference for Featherweight Generic
Java" by Andreas Stadelmeier, Martin Pl√ºmicke and Peter Thiemann.
