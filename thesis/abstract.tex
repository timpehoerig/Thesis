Type systems are an essential and powerful part of every modern programming language.
However, to be forced to explicitly specify every type signature can be tiring or
determining the most general types can even be difficult.
By making type systems able to infer types by themselves these problems become obsolete.
We describe and implement a global type inference algorithm for Featherweight Generic Java: a minimal core calculus for Java (Featherweight Java) extended with generics.
The type inference algorithm is able to infer all method types for a program with specified class headers and field types which does not use polymorphic recursion.
This type inference algorithm was developed by Andreas Stadelmeier, Martin Pl√ºmicke and Peter Thiemann in the paper: "Global Type Inference for Featherweight Generic Java"
