Type systems are an essential and powerful part of every modern programming language.
But to be forced to explicitly write down every type signature can be tiring or
finding the most general types can even be difficult.
By making the type system able to infer types by itself those problems become obsolete.
This is a global type inference algorithm for Featherweight Generic Java: a minimal core calculus for Java (Featherweight Java) extended with generics.
This implements a type inference algorithm defined in the paper "Global Type Inference for Featherweight Generic
Java" by Andreas Stadelmeier, Martin Pl√ºmicke and Peter Thiemann.
