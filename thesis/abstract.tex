Type systems are an essential and powerful part of every modern programming language.
However, to be forced to explicitly specify every type signature can be tiring.
Type inference algorithms relieve the programmer from the burden to write type signatures themselves.
My work describes and implements a global type inference algorithm for Featherweight Generic Java: a minimal core calculus for Java with support for generics.
The type inference algorithm is able to infer all method types for a program with specified class headers and field types.
Originally, the inference algorithm was developed by Andreas Stadelmeier, Martin Pl√ºmicke and Peter Thiemann in the paper: "Global Type Inference for Featherweight Generic Java".
